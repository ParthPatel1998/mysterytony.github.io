<h4 id="definition-left-and-right-inverse">Definition: Left and Right Inverse</h4>
<p>Let $A$ be an $m\x n$ matrix. If $B$ is an $n\x m$ matrix such that $AB=I_m$, then $B$ is called a <strong>right inverse</strong> of $A$. If $C$ is an $n\x n$ matrix such at $CA=I_m$, then $C$ is called a <strong>left inverse</strong> of $A$.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>How would we try to find a right inverse of an $m\x n$ matrix $A$? We want to find an $n\x m$ matrix $B=\begin{bmatrix}\v{b_1} &amp; \cdots &amp; \v{b_m}\end{bmatrix}$ such that</p>
<p>$$\begin{align*} 
I_m &amp;= AB \\
I_m &amp;= A\begin{bmatrix}\v{b_1} &amp; \cdots &amp; \v{b_m}\end{bmatrix} \\
\begin{bmatrix}\v{e_1} &amp; \cdots &amp; \v{e_m}\end{bmatrix} &amp;= \begin{bmatrix}A\v{b_1} &amp; \cdots &amp; A\v{b_m}\end{bmatrix}
\end{align*}$$</p>
<p>Comparing columns, we see that we need to find $\v{b_i}$ such that $A\v{b_i}=\v{e_i}$ for $1\leq i\leq m$. But, this is just solving m systems of linear equations with the same coefficient matrix. To do this, we row reduce the multiple augmented matrix $\begin{bmatrix}A&amp;|&amp;I_m\end{bmatrix}$ to RREF.</p>
<p>For This to work, we require that all m system are consistent. So by Theorem 2.2.5(3), rank(A) = m. Hence, by Theorem 2.2.4, we must $n\geq m$.</p>
<p>Moreover, if $n&lt;m$, then by Theorem 2.2.5(2) we will have infinitely many solutions and hence infinitely many right inverses.</p>
<p>On the other hand, if $n&lt;m$, then all the systems cannot be consistent and hence $A$ cannot have a right inverse.</p>

<p>This theorem says that if any one of the eight items are true for an $n\x n$ matrix, then all of the other items are also true.</p>
<p>Once we have found $A^{-1}$ we can solve any system of linear equation with coefficient matrix $A$ very quickly. Moreover, at first glance, it might seem like we are solving the system of linear equations without row reducing. However, this is an illusion. The row operations are in fact &quot;stored&quot; inside of the inverse of the matrix (we used row operations to find the inverse).</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="5-2-elementary-matrices">5.2 Elementary Matrices</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Consider the system of linear equation $A\v{x}=\v{b}$ where $A$ is invertible. We compare our two methods of solving this system. First, we can solve this system using the methods of Chapter 2 to row reduce the augmented matrix:
$$[A|\v{b}]~[I|\vx]$$
Alternately, we find $A^{-1}$ using the method in the previous section. We row reduce
$$[A|I]~[I|A^{-1}]$$
and then solve the system by computing $\vx=A^{-1}\v{b}$.</p>
<p>Observe that in both methods we can use exactly the same row operations to row reduce $A$ to $I$. In the first method, we are applying those row operations directly to $\v{b}$ to determine $\vx$. Thus, in the second method the row operations used are being &quot;stored&quot; inside of $A^{-1}$ and the matrix vector product $A^{-1}\v{b}$ is &quot;performing&quot; those row operations on $\v{b}$ so that we get the same answer as in the first method.</p>
<p>This not only shows us that $A^{-1}$ is made of elementary row operations, but also that there is a close connection between matrix multiplication and performing elementary row operations.</p>

<h4 id="definition-elementary-matrix">Definition: Elementary Matrix</h4>
<p>An $n\x n$ matrix $E$ is call an <strong>elementary matrix</strong> if it can be obtained from the $n\x n$ identity matrix by performing exactly one elementary row operation.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It is clear that the RREF of every elementary matrix is $I$; we just need to perform the inverse (opposite) row operation to turn the elementary matrix $E$ back to $I$. Thus, we not only have that every elementary matrix is invertible, but the inverse is the elementary matrix associated with the reverse row operation.</p>

$$A=E_1^{-1}E_2^{-1}\cdots E_k^{-1}R$$</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If $A$ is invertible, then we get that the RREF of $A$ is $I$. So, we can write $A$ entirely as a product of elementary matrices. Moreover, by Theorem 6 we have
$$E_k\cdots E_1A=I$$

$$A^{-1}=E_k\cdots E_i$$
Consequently, we can also write $A^{-1}$ as s product of elementary matrices. In particular, we have proven the following corollary</p>

<h2 id="5-3-determinants">5.3 Determinants</h2>
<h4 id="definition-2-x-2-determinant">Definition: $2\x 2$ Determinant</h4>
<p>Let $A=\bm a &amp; b \\ b &amp; d \bmend$. The <strong>determinant</strong> of $A$ is
$$detA=ad-bc$$</p>
<h4 id="remark">Remark</h4>
<p>The determinant is often denoted by vertical straight lines:
$$\vm a &amp; b \\ c &amp; d \vmend = det \bm a &amp; b \\ b &amp; d \bmend = ad-bc$$</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We, of course, want to extend the definition of the determinant to $n\x n$ matrices. So, we next consider the $3\x 3$ case. Let $A = \bm a<em>{11} &amp; a</em>{12} &amp; a<em>{13} \\ a</em>{21} &amp; a<em>{22} &amp; a</em>{23} \\ a<em>{31} &amp; a</em>{32} &amp; a<em>{33} \bmend$. It can be show that $A$ is invertible if and only if
$$a</em>{11}a<em>{22}a</em>{33}-a<em>{11}a</em>{23}a<em>{32}-a</em>{12}a<em>{21}a</em>{33}+a<em>{13}a</em>{21}a<em>{32}+a</em>{12}a<em>{23}a</em>{31}-a<em>{13}a</em>{22}a<em>{31}\neq 0$$
Thus, we define
$$detA=a</em>{11}a<em>{22}a</em>{33}-a<em>{11}a</em>{23}a<em>{32}-a</em>{12}a<em>{21}a</em>{33}+a<em>{13}a</em>{21}a<em>{32}+a</em>{12}a<em>{23}a</em>{31}-a<em>{13}a</em>{22}a_{31}$$</p>
<p>However, we would like to write the formula in a nicer form. Moreover, we would like to find some sort of pattern with this and the $2\x 2$ determinant so that we can figure out how to define the determinant for general $n\x n$ matrices. We observe that
$$a<em>{11}a</em>{22}a<em>{33}-a</em>{11}a<em>{23}a</em>{32}-a<em>{12}a</em>{21}a<em>{33}+a</em>{13}a<em>{21}a</em>{32}+a<em>{12}a</em>{23}a<em>{31}-a</em>{13}a<em>{22}a</em>{31}$$
$$=a<em>{11}(a</em>{22}a<em>{23}-a{23}a{32})-a</em>{21}(a<em>{12}a</em>{33}-a<em>{13}a</em>{32})+a<em>{31}(a</em>{12}a<em>{23}-a</em>{13}a<em>{22})$$
$$=a</em>{11}\vm a<em>{22} &amp; a</em>{23} \\ a<em>{32} &amp; a</em>{33}\vmend - a<em>{21}\vm a</em>{12} &amp; a<em>{13} \\ a</em>{32} &amp; a<em>{33}\vmend + a</em>{31}\vm a<em>{22} &amp; a</em>{13} \\ a<em>{22} &amp; a</em>{23}\vmend$$
Therefore, the $3\x 3$ determinant can be written as a linear combination of $2\x 2$ determinants of submatrices of $A$ where the coefficients are (plus or minus) the coefficients from the first column of $A$.</p>
<p>To extend all of this to $n\x n$ matrices we will recursively use the same pattern.</p>
