# Chapter 7: Energy Storage Elements## 7.1 IntroductionThis chapter introduces two more circuit elements, the capacitor and the inductor. The constitutive equation for the devices involve either integration or differentiation. Consequently:*	Electric circuit that contain capacitors and/or inductors are represented by differential equations. Circuit that do not contain capacitors or inductors are represented by algebraic equations. We say that circuits containing capacitors and/or inductors are **dynamic** circuits, whereas circuits that do not contain capacitors or inductors are **static** circuits.*	Circuits that contain capacitors and/or inductors are able to store energy.*	Circuits that contain capacitors and/or inductors have memory. The voltage and currents at a particular time depend not only other voltages at currents at that same instant of time but also on previous values of those currents and voltages.In addition, we will see that:*	In the absence of unbounded currents or voltages, capacitor voltages and inductor currents are continuous functions of time.*	In a DC circuit, capacitors act like open circuits and inductor act like short circuits.*	Series or parallel capacitors can be reduced to an equivalent capacitor. Series or parallel inductors can be reduced to an equivalent inductor. Doing so does not change the element current or voltage of any other circuit element.*	An op amp and a capacitor can be used to make circuits that perform the mathematical operations of integration or differentiation. Appropriately, these important circuits are called the integrator and the differentiator.*	The element voltages and currents in a circuit containing capacitors and inductors can be complicated functions of time.## 7.2 CapacitorsA capacitor is a circuit element that stores energy in an electric field. A capacitor can be constructed using two parallel conducting plates separated by distance $d$ as shown. ![capacitor](./7.2.1.png "capacitor")Electric charge is stored on the plates, and uniform electric field exist between the conducting plates whenever there is a voltage across the capacitor. The space between the plates if filled with a dielectric material. Some capacitors use impregnated paper for a dielectric, whereas others use mica sheets, ceramics, metal films, or just air. A property of the dielectric material, called the dielectric constant, describes the relationship between the electric field strength and the capacitor voltage. Capacitor are represented by a parameter called the **capacitance**. The capacitance of a capacitor is proportional to the dielectric constant and the surface area of the plates and is inversely proportional to the distance between the plates. In other words, the capacitance $C$ of a capacitor is given by$$C=\frac{\epsilon A}{d}$$where $\epsilon$ is the dielectric constant, $A$ the area of the plates, and $d$ and distance between the plates. The unit of capacitance is coulomb per volt and is call farad (F) in honor of Michael Faraday.A capacitor voltage $v(t)$ deposits a charge $+q(t)$ on one plate and a charge $-q(t)$ on the other plate. We say that the charge $q(t)$ is stored by the capacitor. The charge stored by a capacitor is proportional to the capacitor voltage $v(t)$. Thus we write$$q(t) = C v(t)$$where the constant of proportionality $C$ is the capacitance of the capacitor.**Capacitance is the measure of the ability of a device to store energy in the form of a separated charge or an electric field.**In general, the capacitor voltage $v(t)$ varies as a function of time. Consequently, $q(t)$, the charge stored by the capacitor, also varies as a function of time. The variation of the capacitor charge with respect to time implies a capacitor current $i(t)$ given by$$i(t) = \frac{d}{dt} q(t)$$We differentiate to obtain$$i(t) = C \frac{d}{dt} v(t)$$The above equation is the current-voltage relationship of a capacitor. The current and voltage adhere to the passive convention. The figure shows two alternative symbols to represent capacitors in circuit diagram. In both, the capacitor current and voltage adhere to the passive sign convention and are related to the above equation.![capacitor](./7.2.2.png "capacitor")Now consider the waveform shown, in which the voltage changes from a constant voltage of zero to another constant voltage of 1 over an increment of time, $\Delta t$, using the equation, we obtain$$i(t) = \begin{cases}0 & \quad t < 0 \\\\frac{C}{Dt} & \quad 0 < t < Dt \\\0 & \quad t > Dt\end{cases}$$![capacitor](./7.2.3.png "capacitor")Thus, we obtain a pulse of height equal to $C/\Delta t$. As $\Delta t$ changes, the current will increase. Clearly, $\Delta t$ cannot decline to zero or we would experience an infinite current. An infinite current is an impossibility because it would require infinite power. Thus, an instantaneous $(Dt=0)$ change of voltage across the capacitor is not possible. In other words, we cannot have a discontinuity in $v(t)$.**The voltage across a capacitor cannot change instantaneously**.Now let us find the voltage $v(t)$ in terms of the current $i(t)$ by integrating both sides. We obtain$$v(t) = \frac{1}{C} \int_{- \infty}^{t} i(\tau) d \tau$$This equation says that the capacitor voltage $v(t)$ can be found by integrating the capacitor current from the time $- \infty$ until time $t$. To do so requires that we know the value of the capacitor current from time $\tau = - \infty$ until time $\tau = t$. Often, we don't know the value of the current all the way back to $\tau = t$. Instead, we break the integral up into two parts:$$v(t) = \frac{1}{C} \int_{t_0}^{t} i(\tau)d\tau + \frac{1}{C} \int_{- \infty}^{t_0}i(\tau)d\tau = \frac{1}{C} \int_{t_0}^{t} i(\tau)d\tau + v(t_0)$$This equation says that the capacitor voltage $t(t)$ can be found by integrating the capacitor current from some convenient time $\tau = t_0$ until time $\tau =t$, provided that we also know the capacitor voltage at time $t_0$. Now we are required to know only the capacitor current from time $\tau = t_0$ until time $\tau = t$. The time $t_0$ is called the **initial time**, and the capacitor voltage $v(t_0)$ is called the **initial condition**. Frequently, it is convenient to select $t_0 = 0$ as the initial time.Capacitors are commercially available in a variety of types and capacitance values. Capacitor types are described in terms of the dielectric material and the construction technique. Miniature mental film capacitors are shown in the figure. Miniature hermetically sealed polycarbonate capacitors are also shown in the figure. Capacitance values typically range from picofarads $(pF)$ to microfarads $(\mu F)$.![capacitor](./7.2.4.png "capacitor")Two pieces of insulated wire about an inch long when twisted together will have a capacitance of about $1pF$. On the other hand, a power supply capacitor about an inch in diameter and a few inches long may have a capacitance of $0.01F$.Actual capacitors have some resistance associated with them. Fortunately, it is easy to include approximate resistive effects in the current models. In capacitors, the dielectric material between the plates is not a perfect insulator and has some small conductivity. This can be represented by a very high resistance in parallel with the capacitor. Ordinary capacitors can hold a charge for hours, and the parallel resistance is then hundreds of megaohms. For this reason, the resistance associated with a capacitor is usually ignored.## 7.3 Energy Storage in a CapacitorConsider a capacitor that has been connected to a battery of voltage $v$. A current flows and a charge is stored on the plates of the capacitor. Eventually, the voltage across the capacitor is a constant, and the current through the capacitor is zero. The capacitor has stored energy by virtue of the separation of charge between the capacitor plates. These charges have an electrical force acting on them.
