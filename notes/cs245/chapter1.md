# Introduction to Logic

**Logic** is the systematic study of the principles of reasoning and inference.

A **proposition** is a declarative sentence that is either **true** or **false**.

English phrases for connectives

*	$\lnot p$:	not $p$; $p$ does not hold; $p$ is false; it is not the case that $p$
*	$p\land q$:	$p$ and $q$; $p$ but $q$; not only $p$ but $q$; $p$ while $q$; $p$ despite $q$; $p$ yet $q$; $p$ although $q$
*	$p\lor q$:	$p$ or $q$; $p$ or $q$ or both; $p$ and/or $q$; $p$ unless $q$
*	$p \rightarrow q$:	if $p$ then $q$; $p$ implies $q$; $q$ if $p$; $p$ only if $q$; $q$ when $p$
*	$p\leftrightarrow q$:	$p$ if and only if ($p$ iff $q$); $p$ is equivalent to $q$; $p$ exactly if $q$; $p$ is necessary and sufficient for $q$

Propositional logic is a form of **symbolic** logic. that is, it uses strings of symbols to represent propositions and to build arguments.

A symbolic logic is formalized by the following:

**Syntax**: What statements to we consider?

**Semantics**: What does a statement mean?

**Proof procedures**: Given a statement, can we prove it true?
